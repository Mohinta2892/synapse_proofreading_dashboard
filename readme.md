Synful (Buhmann et al. 2021) models on our Drosophila larval datasets predict a lot of False Positives.
We recruited the help of scientists in both Cardona and Zlatic Lab to review those False Positive predictions. 
This dashboard adds a *competitive* edge to the whole proofreading process and also helps us visualize an individual's proofreading dynamics and their agreement with a chosen `pro domain expert`.
Ultimately, from this dashboard, we wish to tease out the agreement of proofreaders over annotating a
particular False Positive prediction as either `correct` (means actually it is synapse and not really a false positive) or `incorrect` (means it is a false prediction and there is no synapse).
